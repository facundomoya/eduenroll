# EduEnroll â€“ Backend Practice Project

## Project Description

EduEnroll is a backend-only practice project focused on learning and applying modern Node.js development techniques. It simulates a basic educational management system to demonstrate the creation of RESTful APIs, the use of Sequelize ORM for database operations, and the implementation of backend architectural patterns.

Note: This project is still in development and intended for backend practice purposes only.  
No frontend is included.

## Main Features

### RESTful API Development
- Full CRUD operations for all entities
- Consistent and structured API responses
- Proper HTTP status code usage
- Global error-handling middleware

### Database Operations
- Sequelize ORM for data modeling
- Model relationships and associations
- Database migrations and seeders
- Query optimization patterns

### User Management
- Multi-role authentication system
- Support for students, professors, and administrators
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secure password handling

### File Upload & Management
- PDF file upload with Multer
- File validation and storage
- Secure file access and download
- Error handling for file operations

---

## Technologies Used

### Backend Core
- Node.js â€“ Runtime environment
- Express.js â€“ Web framework
- Sequelize ORM â€“ Database abstraction
- MySQL / PostgreSQL â€“ Relational database

### File Handling
- Multer â€“ Middleware for file upload
- Native fs and path modules

### Development Tools
- ES6 Modules
- dotenv â€“ Environment configuration
- Git â€“ Version control

## Learning Objectives

This project allows hands-on practice with:

1. Express.js Framework
   - Route handling and middleware
   - Controller structure
   - Request/response lifecycle

2. Sequelize ORM
   - Defining models and associations
   - Running queries and managing data
   - Migrations and seeders

3. API Design Patterns
   - Separation of concerns
   - RESTful practices

4. Service Layer Architecture
   - Isolated business logic
   - Reusable service functions
   - Scalable and testable structure

5. File Operations
   - Secure PDF upload and storage
   - File retrieval endpoints
   - Input validation

## API Endpoints

### User Management

```bash
GET    /users                â†’ Get all users  
GET    /users/:id            â†’ Get user by ID  
POST   /users/professor      â†’ Create a professor  
POST   /users/admin          â†’ Create an admin  
PUT    /users/:id            â†’ Update a user  
DELETE /users/:id            â†’ Delete a user  
```

### Degree Management

```bash
GET    /degrees              â†’ Get all degrees  
GET    /degrees/:id          â†’ Get degree by ID  
POST   /degrees              â†’ Create a degree  
PUT    /degrees/:id          â†’ Update a degree
```

### File Operations

```bash
GET    /users/:id/pdf        â†’ Download a users PDF
POST   /upload               â†’ Upload a PDF file
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/eduenroll.git
```

2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Environment Configuration

- Create a .env file in the root directory with your database credentials:

```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASS=your_password
DB_NAME=eduenroll
```

4. Database Setup (Sequelize)

```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:create
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
```

5. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```
