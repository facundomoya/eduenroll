# EduEnroll â€“ Backend Project

## Project Description

EduEnroll is a backend project focused on learning and applying modern Node.js development techniques. It simulates a basic educational management system to demonstrate the creation of RESTful APIs, the use of Sequelize ORM for database operations, and the implementation of backend architectural patterns.

Note: No frontend is included.

---

## Main Features

### RESTful API Development
- Full CRUD operations for all entities
- Consistent and structured API responses
- Proper HTTP status code usage
- Global error-handling middleware

### Database Operations
- Sequelize ORM for data modeling
- Model relationships and associations
- Database migrations and seeders
- Query optimization patterns

### User Management
- Multi-role authentication system
- Support for professors and administrators
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secure password handling

---

## Technologies Used

### Backend Core
- Node.js â€“ Runtime environment
- Express.js â€“ Web framework
- Sequelize ORM â€“ Database abstraction
- MySQL â€“ Relational database

---

## Code Management

The project was developed using a simple Git workflow, where:

- **Single active branch**: `master` (or `main` in modern repositories)

---

## Learning Objectives

This project allows hands-on practice with:

1. Express.js Framework
   - Route handling and middleware
   - Controller structure
   - Request/response lifecycle

2. Sequelize ORM
   - Defining models and associations
   - Running queries and managing data

3. API Design Patterns
   - Separation of concerns
   - RESTful practices

4. Service Layer Architecture
   - Isolated business logic
   - Reusable service functions
   - Scalable and testable structure
